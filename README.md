# Kendalls-Logo-Maker

## Description
This command-line application creates simple SVG logos using inputs from the user. This creates a way for developers to create their own logos without having to pay for a graphic designer. In the command line, it will first ask the user to input up to three characters, the color that you would like your text, the shape of your logo (triangle, circle, or square), and the color that you would like to fill the shape. The user will then be prompted in the command line that an SVG file has been generated. That generated SVG file will contain the logo with the specifications that you entered in the command line.

## Usage 
This application is used within the command line. Once the user has the installation done, they will then be ready to start the application. Once the user enters node index.js to start, they will then be prompted to answer a series of questions. After all questions have been answered, a message will appear in the command line that tells the user their SVG file has been generated, where the users new logo will be!
